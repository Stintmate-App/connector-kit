# Changelog

## 0.1.1 (2026-10-31)

- `contract.json` lists every method and event name the documents use.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-31)

First release of the connector kit.

- The skeleton connector (`skeleton/`, Python, stintmate-ipc 0.3.1) with its conformance tests,
  the fetch script for the transport wheel and the notes on the native interface (`native/`).
- Documentation, each claim checked against the code of Pitwall and the managing app:
  the author's guide (`docs/guide.md`), the connector protocol, the connectors page, the
  channels Pitwall publishes, the data model, the write API with its JSON Schema, the
  connector side of the application contract, the connector descriptor and the catalogs format.
- `contract.json`: the connector-facing names, the error codes, the vocabularies and the limits
  the documents state, as values read from the code.
- The Apache-2.0 licence.
